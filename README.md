# JS-Documentation

This project is part of a series of projects for the **Responsive Web Design** course on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). It serves as a technical documentation page for JavaScript concepts, built solely using **HTML** and **CSS**.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to practice and improve my web development skills, specifically focusing on:

- **Semantic HTML:** Using meaningful HTML5 elements to structure the content of the documentation.
- **CSS Styling:** Enhancing the visual appeal of the page using custom styles.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**

No JavaScript or external libraries/frameworks were used in this project as it focuses solely on practicing the fundamentals of front-end design.

## Features

- A **fixed sidebar** for easy navigation between sections of the documentation.
- **Custom styling** of code blocks, using carefully selected colors to enhance readability.
- The page design was inspired by the color palette of GitHub and other popular documentation pages.

## Live Demo

This project is hosted on **GitHub Pages**. You can view the live version of the JS-Documentation page at the following URL:
